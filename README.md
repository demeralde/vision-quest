## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Fork the repository.**

    Fork this repository on GitHub to create your own vision board.

2.  **Add photos to your vision board.**

    a) Create a subfolder for each section of your vision board, such as `src/photos/board/Health & Fitness`. The name of the subfolder will be used as a title for the section on the vision board, e.g _"Health & Fitness"_

    b) Add photos to each subfolder. The filename of each photo will be used as its tooltip/alt text.

    **Supported image formats:** `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, and `.webp`

    Some suggestions for finding high quality photos are [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/).

3.  **Configure the environment variables.**

    Add a `.env` file with your information to customise the vision board settings:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Then edit `.env` in your editor.

4.  **Add your avatar.**

    Add a headshot of yourself to `src/images/avatar.jpg`. It will add this photo to the top of the vision board.

5.  **Start the development server.**

    ```shell
    cd vision-quest/
    yarn develop
    ```

    The server will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

You can build the vision board and deploy it manually yourself:

```shell
yarn build
yarn serve
```

Or you can deploy your vision board with one click on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup):

If you deploy it online, I suggest adding password protection for privacy. Netlify has an option for this, as do most cloud services.

Otherwise you can run it locally on your device with the development server (or `yarn build` and `yarn serve`).
